# DAS Development Freelance Website

## Overview

Features a responsive design, active menu selection, SEO integration, form, form validation, Google Cloud functions, Nodemailer, progress indicator (i.e. loading spinner), Snackbar components (provides brief feedback messages of action performed - e.g. "Message sent"), and cross-browser support.'
